THIS IS AN ADAPTION OF THE ORIGINAL SPA CODE.

FOR PROF. DAVID BIRD'S ALLOCATION PROBLEM, 53 STUDENTS CHOOSE 5 CHOICES FROM A LIST OF 48 ESSAY TOPICS. THE CODE HAS BEEN MODIFIED TO REFLECT THESE NEW NUMBERS.

AT MOST 2 STUDENTS CAN BE GIVEN A PARTICULAR ESSAY. THE CODE HAS BEEN MODIFIED TO REFLECT THIS IN THE CHECKING CONSTRAINTS FUNCTION.

ALSO AS THERE ARE NO SUPERVISORS, THE SUPERVISOR CONSTRAINTS AND THUS THE SUPERVISOR CSV FILE DO NOT PLAY A ROLE IN THE ALLOCATION. FOR THE PURPOSE OF NOT TAMPERING WITH THE CODE UNNECESSARILY I HAVE LEFT THESE PARTS OF THE CODE IN BUT THEY DO NOT HAVE ANY EFFECT.

## Usage

The main variables are entered at compile time. In the `Program.c` file set the following variables:

1. `char fileName1[]`: The csv file for the students list - JUST REPLACE 'STUDENTESSAYEXAMPLE.CSV' WITH WHATEVER YOUR FILE IS CALLED
2. `char fileName2[]`: The csv file for the supervisors list - NO NEED TO DO ANYTHING TO THIS AS WE DON'T HAVE SUPERVISOR CONSTRAINTS
3. `int rows`: The number of rows in `fileName1` i.e. NUMBER OF ESSAYS - ALREADY UPDATED
4. `int cols`: The number of columns in `fileName1` i.e NUMBER OF STUDENTS - ALREADY UPDATED
5. `#define cols`: Same as above.
6. `int numLec`: The number of columns in `fileName2` i.e. NOT APPLICABLE JUST LEAVE AS IT IS

From the root directory run the make file:

```sh
make
```

And run

```sh
./spa.out
```

Results appear in `finalConfig.txt`.
